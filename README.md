# Peanut-Allergy-App
translate one sentence in every languages I could find. Works offline

### Why this app

I created this app because I traveled in countries where I didn't know the alphabet, and for me, it was difficult to make people understand I was allergic to peanut. When it comes to eating at the restaurant, not being sure that the cook doesn't use Peanut oil to cook was a big issue. I went to the hospital a couple times and decided it was time for me to build an app that would very easily make people understand my peanut allergy. 

In addition, I wanted an app that works offline: no need of the internet. It makes sense since when you travel, you don't have access to the internet all the time... but your allergy is here all the time!

I have been using my app on my phone for quite a while around the world, and people I met asked me if I could make it available on the app store. So here it is. Please leave some feedback on the translations, so that I can improve it!
